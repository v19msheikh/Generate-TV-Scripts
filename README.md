# Generate-TV-Scripts

Introduction You'll use RNNs to create your own Seinfeld TV scripts in this project. You'll be working with scripts from all nine seasons of Seinfeld. A fresh, "fake" TV screenplay will be generated by the Neural Network you'll create.



Obtaining project files The project files can be found in the project-tv-script-generation folder of our public GitHub repo. You can download the files from there, however it's recommended that you clone the repository to your computer using the following command:
